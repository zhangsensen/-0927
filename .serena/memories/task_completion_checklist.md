# Task Completion Checklist

1. Run relevant scripts/tests automatically after code changes (per user preference) using `run_in_terminal`.
2. Ensure any backtest outputs are stored in Parquet (no pickle) with metadata JSON.
3. Update configs/YAML if new factors or settings introduced.
4. Review logs/console output for warnings or failures; iterate until clean.
5. Summarize work done, metrics obtained, and next steps in final response; reference modified file paths.
