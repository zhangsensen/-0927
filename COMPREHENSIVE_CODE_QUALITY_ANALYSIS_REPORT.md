```

**Critical Issue**: The `ProfessionalFactorScreener` class has a complexity of 503, far exceeding the recommended threshold of 20. This indicates the class is doing too much and violates Single Responsibility Principle.

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate**: Refactor `ProfessionalFactorScreener` into 5-7 focused classes
- **Short-term**: Break down any function with complexity > 20 into smaller functions
- **Target**: All functions should have complexity < 10
